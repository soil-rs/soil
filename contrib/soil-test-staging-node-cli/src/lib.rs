//! Substrate CLI library.
//!
//! This package has two Cargo features:
//!
//! - `cli` (default): exposes functions that parse command-line options, then start and run the
//! node as a CLI application.
//!
//! - `browser`: exposes the content of the `browser` module, which consists of exported symbols
//! that are meant to be passed through the `wasm-bindgen` utility and called from JavaScript.
//! Despite its name the produced WASM can theoretically also be used from NodeJS, although this
//! hasn't been tested.
